- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images
- Flexbox
- Media quary

### What I learned

In this section I recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project.

Responsive images:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 900px)"
    srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  />
  <img
    class="product-photo"
    src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Product image"
  />
</picture>
```

Link Google fonts:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz,wght@9..144,700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  --cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
  --very-dark-blue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
  --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the near future I would like to continue working on another FEM challenges. I still have a room for improvement in my HTML and CSS skills. For example GRID, animations... Than I am going to add JavaScript into my projects and create my first web-app.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This page/project helped me a lot when I did not know a CSS property or when to use a proper HTML element.
